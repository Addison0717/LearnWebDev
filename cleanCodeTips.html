      <h1>Clean Code</h1>
      <p>Writing clean code is what you must know and do in order to call yourself a professional developer. There is no reasonable excuse for doing anything less than your best.</p>
      <h2>First of all, what does clean coding mean?</h2>
      <p>Clean coding means that in the first place you write code for your later self and for your co-workers and not for the machine.</p>
      <p>Your code must be easily understandable for humans.</p>

      <p>You know you are working on a clean code when each routine you read turns out to be pretty much what you expected.</p>

      <h2>JavaScript Clean Coding Best Practices</h2>
      <h4>How should I name my variables?</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><p>Use intention-revealing names and don't worry if you have long variable names instead of saving a few keyboard strokes.</p></li>
        <li><p>If you follow this practice, your names become searchable, which helps a lot when you do refactors or you are just looking for something.</p></li>
        <li><p>Also, make meaningful distinctions and don't add extra, unnecessary nouns to the variable names, like its type (hungarian notation).</p></li>
        <li><p>Make your variable names easy to pronounce, because for the human mind it takes less effort to process.</p></li>
        <li><p>When you are doing code reviews with your fellow developers, these names are easier to reference.</p></li>
      </ul>
      <h4>How should I write my functions?</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><p>Your functions should do one thing only on one level of abstraction.</p> </li>
          <li><p>Use long, descriptive names</p> </li>
          <li><p>Avoid long argument list</p> </li>
          <li><p>Reduce side effects</p></li>
          <li> <p>Organize your functions in a file according to the stepdown rule</p> </li>
