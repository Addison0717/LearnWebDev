     <h1>Flex Box</h1>

     <p>The Flexbox Layout (Flexible Box) module (currently a W3C Last Call Working Draft)
        aims at providing a more efficient way to lay out, align and distribute space among
        items in a container, even when their size is unknown and/or dynamic (thus the word "flex").</p>

    <h2>Basics & Terminology</h2>

    <p>Since flexbox is a whole module and not a single property, it involves a lot of things
       including its whole set of properties. Some of them are meant to be set on the container
       (parent element, known as "flex container") whereas the others are meant to be set on the children
       (said "flex items").</p>

    <p>If regular layout is based on both block and inline flow directions, the flex layout is based on
      "flex-flow directions". Please have a look at this figure from the specification, explaining the
      main idea behind the flex layout.</p>

    <ul>
      <li><h4>main axis</h4><p>- The main axis of a flex container is the primary axis along which flex items are laid out. Beware, it is not necessarily horizontal; it depends on the flex-direction property (see below).</p></li>
      <li><h4>main-start | main-end</h4><p>The flex items are placed within the container starting from main-start and going to main-end.</p></li>
      <li><h4>main size</h4><p>- A flex item's width or height, whichever is in the main dimension, is the item's main size. The flex item's main size property is either the ‘width’ or ‘height’ property, whichever is in the main dimension.</p></li>
      <li><h4>cross axis</h4><p>- The axis perpendicular to the main axis is called the cross axis. Its direction depends on the main axis direction.</p></li>
      <li><h4>cross-start | cross-end</h4><p>- Flex lines are filled with items and placed into the container starting on the cross-start side of the flex container and going toward the cross-end side.</p></li>
      <li><h4>cross size</h4><p>- The width or height of a flex item, whichever is in the cross dimension, is the item's cross size. The cross size property is whichever of ‘width’ or ‘height’ that is in the cross dimension.</p></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Properties for Parents</h2>
    <div class="">
      <h3>#display</h3>
      <p>This defines a flex container; inline or block depending on the given value. It enables a flex context for all its direct children.</p>
      <h3>#flex-direction</h3>
      <p>This establishes the main-axis, thus defining the direction flex items are placed in the flex container. Flexbox is (aside from optional wrapping) a single-direction layout concept. Think of flex items as primarily laying out either in horizontal rows or vertical columns.</p>
      <h3>#flex-wrap</h3>
      <p>By default, flex items will all try to fit onto one line. You can change that and allow the items to wrap as needed with this property.</p>
      <h3>#flex-flow</h3>
      <p>This is a shorthand flex-direction and flex-wrap properties, which together define the flex container's main and cross axes. Default is row nowrap.</p>
      <h3>#justify-content</h3>
      <p>This defines the alignment along the main axis. It helps distribute extra free space left over when either all the flex items on a line are inflexible, or are flexible but have reached their maximum size. It also exerts some control over the alignment of items when they overflow the line.</p>
      <h3>#align-items</h3>
      <p>This defines the default behaviour for how flex items are laid out along the cross axis on the current line. Think of it as the justify-content version for the cross-axis (perpendicular to the main-axis).</p>
      <h3>#align-content</h3>
      <p>This aligns a flex container's lines within when there is extra space in the cross-axis, similar to how justify-content aligns individual items within the main-axis.</p>

    </div>

    <h2>Properties for Items</h2>
    <div class="">
      <h3>#oder</h3>
      <p>By default, flex items are laid out in the source order. However, the order property controls the order in which they appear in the flex container.</p>
      <h3>#flex-grow</h3>
      <p>This defines the ability for a flex item to grow if necessary. It accepts a unitless value that serves as a proportion. It dictates what amount of the available space inside the flex container the item should take up.</p>
      <h3>#flex-shrink</h3>
      <p>This defines the ability for a flex item to shrink if necessary.</p>
      <h3>#flex-basis</h3>
      <p>This defines the default size of an element before the remaining space is distributed. It can be a length (e.g. 20%, 5rem, etc.) or a keyword. The auto keyword means "look at my width or height property" (which was temporarily done by the main-size keyword until deprecated). The content keyword means "size it based on the item's content" - this keyword isn't well supported yet, so it's hard to test and harder to know what its brethren max-content, min-content, and fit-content do.</p>
      <h3>#flex</h3>
      <p>This is the shorthand for flex-grow, flex-shrink and flex-basis combined. The second and third parameters (flex-shrink and flex-basis) are optional. Default is 0 1 auto.</p>
      <h3>#align-self</h3>
      <p>This allows the default alignment (or the one specified by align-items) to be overridden for individual flex items. Please see the align-items explanation to understand the available values.</p>
